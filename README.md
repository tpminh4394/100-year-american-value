# 100-year-american-value

This paper analysed 26 American presidential inauguration speeches to identify Schwartz’s
human values trend in the last 100 years. The dictionary method and LLM method using Mistral
LLM were adopted and compared in detail with several case studies. The result shows a slight
advantage in favor of the LLM model with its ability to comprehend subtle wording that would be
impossible for a dictionary to detect. Based on the result of the LLM method, self-transcendence
was the defining value of the Democrats with some openness mixing in. Conservation value has
been declining since 1925 and is nowhere to be found recently. For Republicans, the value
landscape is a tug of war between self-transcendence and conservation with conservation on
the rise recently. Self-enhancement values are rare to find in both parties over the last 100 years
but has found its resurgence in the recent two Trump’s administrations.
